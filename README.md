# Commitm: Commit Messages Done Quickly!
Commitm is a script to output a commit message randomly picked
from a list.

## Contributing
Want to add commit messages? You’re welcome.

Just fork, update [commitm.yml](./blob/master/commitm.yml), and
create a pull request.

Guidelines:
* No profanity.
* Keep it brief. Shorter than 65 characters is great.
* Add to the appropriate message list for the language. Put under
  `'*'` if it’s not language-specific.
* Feel free to add another language if one.

I don’t get paid to do this, so, please be patient if I don’t
merge your pull request in a timely manner. Also, it’s up to me
whether I do it.
