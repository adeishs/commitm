# Commitm: Commit Messages Done Quickly!
Commitm is a script to output a commit message randomly picked
from a list.

## Contributing
Want to add commit messages? You’re welcome.

Just fork, update the common, language-agnostic message list:

[messages/_.yml](messages/_.yml)

Or language-specific commit messages, such as: 

[messages/pl.yml](messages/pl.yml)

where the file basename is the common language source code extension. 

Guidelines:
* No profanity.
* Keep it brief. Shorter than 65 characters is great.
* Feel free to add new file(s) for your language of choice, too.

I don’t get paid to do this, so, please be patient if I don’t
merge your pull request in a timely manner. Also, it’s up to me
whether I do it.
