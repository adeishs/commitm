# Commitm: Commit Messages Done Quickly!
Commitm is a script to output a commit message randomly picked
from a list.

## Contributing
Want to add commit messages? You’re welcome.

Just fork, update one/some/all of these message files by running:
* Common, language-agnostic:
  ```
  commitm -add "New commit message"
  ```
* Language-specific, such as: 
  ```
  commitm -lang perl -add "New commit message"
  ```

Guidelines:
* No profanity.
* Keep it brief. Shorter than 65 characters is great.
* Feel free to add new file(s) for your language of choice, too.

I don’t get paid to do this, so, please be patient if I don’t
merge your pull request in a timely manner. Also, it’s up to me
whether I do it.
